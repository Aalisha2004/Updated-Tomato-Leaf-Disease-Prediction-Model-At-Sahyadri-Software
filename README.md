# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

This project is a deep learning-based web application designed to detect various diseases in tomato leaves. Built using TensorFlow and Gradio, it allows users to upload a tomato leaf image and receive a prediction along with confidence levels for each class.

## 📌 Project Summary

* **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* **Frameworks Used:** TensorFlow, Keras, Gradio
* **Goal:** Detect and classify tomato leaf diseases from uploaded images
* **Dataset:** Tomato Leaf Disease dataset (from Kaggle or PlantVillage)


## 🧠 Classes Detected

The model can classify tomato leaves into the following categories:

* Bacterial Spot
* Early Blight
* Late Blight
* Leaf Mold
* Septoria Leaf Spot
* Spider Mites (Two-Spotted)
* Target Spot
* Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
* Mosaic Virus
* Healthy


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Gradio
* Google Colab
